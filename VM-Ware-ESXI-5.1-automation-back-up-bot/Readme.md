### Find an open source solution to do a live back-up on an VMWare ESXi 5.1 server.

###### This project was also my final project for my AP Degree. 

Found 2 solutions.

First solution:
Write an Windows automation script in Python that simulates the work of a human doing a "manual back-up":

* select the target Virtual machine;
* take a snapshot;
* move the folder containing the virtual machine on another data storage hard drive.

Second solution
XSI Backup: use Command Line Interface to install and use the software.
